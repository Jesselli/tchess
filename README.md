# Chess in the terminal

This is a simple implementation of a chess client in the terminal. This is not highly polished code. It's not the optimal way to implement a game of chess. 
I just wanted to work on a small project to learn a bit of Go. There are no package dependencies. However if you want to use an engine you need to have
stockfish installed and on your PATH.

Here's a demo of the app running with typed-in moves:
